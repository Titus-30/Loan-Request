## Description
This is a Java-based application for processing loan requests. The system allows a client to apply for a loan by entering their salary, loan amount, and loan period. The application validates the input data, calculates the repayment schedule, and allows the client to make payments towards the loan.

## Features
- **Salary Validation**: Ensures that the salary entered is above a minimum threshold of 5,000,000.
- **Loan Period Validation**: Ensures that the loan period does not exceed 12 months.
- **Repayment Schedule**: Displays the loan repayment schedule including monthly interest, principal, and remaining balance.
- **Loan Payment**: Allows the client to make payments towards the loan, showing remaining balance if fully or partially paid.

## Requirements
- Java version 8 or higher.
- A terminal or IDE to run Java applications.
